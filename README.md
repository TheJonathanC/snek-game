# snek-game
A game created by ME on pygame.
You can try playing that game in different speeds, yall just have to change the speed.
Also I have explained almost all the code so yall can play around with it.

How to use:
1. Copy paste the code on your local python file and save
2. make sure you have pygame installed
3. Run the script and a window of the game should open up

If the game controls arent working, just make sure you have the window selected.
